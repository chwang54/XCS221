You might notice that our search algorithm explores quite a large number of
states even for the $8\times 8$ board. Let's see if we can do better. One
heuristic we discussed in class is using most constrained variable (MCV): To
choose an unassigned variable, pick the $X_j$ that has the fewest number of
values $a$ which are consistent with the current partial assignment ($a$ for
which |get_delta_weight()| on $X_j=a$ returns a non-zero value).

Implement this heuristic in |get_unassigned_variable()| under the condition
|self.mcv = True|. It should take you exactly 1361 operations to find all
optimal assignments for 8 queens CSP --- that's 30\% fewer!
